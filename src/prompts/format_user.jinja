Please format the following plan information into a simple, clear list.

PLAN DETAILS
{{ plan_json }}

The plan_json contains:
- "selected_plan": The main plan that was selected for execution
- "all_plans": An array of all alternative plans with their confidence scores

INSTRUCTIONS
Create a simple numbered list showing:
1. For EACH plan in "all_plans", show ONLY:
   - Plan number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - The complete list of tool/node names in execution order (numbered modules within the plan)
   - Reasoning (why this plan/approach was chosen) - if available in the plan
   - Confidence score at the end
   - Mark which one is SELECTED

FORMAT RULES:
- Start each plan with its number (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- List the modules/tools in order with sub-numbers (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)
- IMPORTANT: After each module/tool, show its reasoning on the next line with the same sub-number followed by "Reason:"
- Show overall plan reasoning starting with "Reasoning: " if available
- Show confidence like "Confidence: 0.92" after reasoning
- Add "[SELECTED]" marker for the selected plan
- NO extra text, NO descriptions, NO headers, NO footers
- JUST the numbered list

EXAMPLE:
1. [SELECTED]
   1.1 tool_name_1
   1.1 Reason: This tool fetches the required data using pattern matching
   1.2 tool_name_2
   1.2 Reason: This tool processes and filters the fetched data
   Reasoning: This approach uses the most direct path to solve the problem with minimal steps.
   Confidence: 0.88

2.
   2.1 tool_name_3
   2.1 Reason: Single-step solution that handles both fetching and filtering internally
   Reasoning: Alternative approach that provides more validation but requires extra step.
   Confidence: 0.85

OUTPUT FORMAT
Plain text numbered list only. Nothing else.
